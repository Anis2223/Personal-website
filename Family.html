<p align="center">My family and I used to spend our free time with watching television together every night while enjoying some desserts 
<br>such as fruit, pudding, cookies, potato chips and my mom's cooking. Some of our favorite family dramas include Tv3 such as "Nur", "Dosa Wakaf",
<br>"Pesan Pada Hati" and "Hello Mr.Perfect and we also do Korean dramas like" Goblin "," Ugly Alert "," Happy Sister ”,“ Memorist ”and others.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">In addition, our family will also be traveling to Kuala Lumpur, Cameron Highland, Langkawi, Melaka and others upon the school holidays.

<br>we will stay at my aunt's house at Putrajaya. After that we will visit some of the tourist attractions. The atmosphere was very lively as we were able 
<br>to come together as a family who could only feel that way when we were together.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Furthermore, our family also regularly playing the bowling. This is because my brother is good at bowling and my mother always play 
<br>bowling with her friends when there was a bowling program run by her school. Therefore, bowling is one of our family hobbies when it comes to free
<br>time such as school holidays.</font>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">Finally, during this month of Ramadan. Every evening I would help cook a meal to break the fast together. In the night, we prayer 
<br>“magrib” and “isyak” congregation and we terawih prayer of “8 rakaat” that my brother Muhammad Adam Harith has become “imam”. After the prayer, 
<br>we would enjoy a “moreh” of food while watching television together to spend some time together.</font>
